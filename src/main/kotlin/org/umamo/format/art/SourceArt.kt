/**
 * Stable identity of a source-art layer, format-agnostic.
 *
 * `@JvmInline value class` wraps a String with zero runtime overhead (the compiler erases it
 * to a bare String where it can) while making the type distinct - you can't accidentally pass a
 * raw layer name where a layer id is expected. This replaces the "stringly-typed" anti-pattern
 * (`Map<String, …>` keyed by ambiguous strings). The meaning of the wrapped value depends on
 * the source: CLIP supplies Celsys's rename-stable internal id; PSD can only offer a name/path.
 *
 * The `kotlin.jvm.JvmInline` import is load-bearing, not noise: `kotlin.jvm.*` is a default import
 * only on JVM targets, so without it this file stops compiling the moment a non-JVM target
 * (Kotlin/Native, for iPadOS) is added.  The annotation is an optional expectation, so non-JVM
 * targets simply ignore it.

 * eventual SourceArt to puppet-model ingest should use: that path keeps the two flags separate
 * (each layer's own [SourceLayer.visible] seeds its drawable's eye toggle, each folder's
 * [SourceGroup.visible] seeds the part the folder becomes) and lets the runtime's part-chain
 * visibility cascade hide a still-"visible" layer whose ancestor part is hidden. Flattening here
 * would discard the per-layer intent the artist may want back when they re-show a folder. Use this
