# AIlive2dpsd

[中文](README.md) | [日本語](README_ja.md)

Maintained by [zhangxiaoyu66666](https://github.com/zhangxiaoyu66666), based on [tsunehimatoi/PSD2Live](https://github.com/tsunehimatoi/psd2live), under GPL-3.0. This fork retains the upstream modeling and export capabilities and adds the desktop workflows below.

AIlive2dpsd is an automated Live2D model generation pipeline and desktop application. Given a layered PSD file, the system automatically performs semantic layer recognition, 8-connected bilateral splitting, adaptive Delaunay mesh triangulation, 9-pose facial lattice construction, multi-pendulum hair dynamics, and seamless idle loop generation, exporting both editable `.cmo3` editor projects and runtime `.moc3` file families.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Use this fork:** Check [AIlive2dpsd Releases](https://github.com/zhangxiaoyu66666/AIlive2dpsd/releases) for published builds. If none is available, run from source or use `./gradlew.bat createDistributable` to build the Windows application with its Java runtime. Upstream PSD2Live releases do not include this fork’s additions.

## Added in this fork

- **Independent project tabs:** separate parameters, undo history and previews; scrollable tabs with active-tab reveal. `Ctrl+N` creates a tab; `Ctrl+W` closes it.
- **Save all:** File → Save all or `Ctrl+Alt+S`; existing paths save directly, new projects request locations in sequence, and empty or unchanged saved tabs are skipped.
- **Save before closing:** one Save all and close / Discard all / Cancel choice. Cancellation, write failures or new edits keep every project open.
- **Preview by default:** startup, new tabs and PSD imports open the preview. Menu opens create tabs; a single-file drop replaces the current tab only after a successful load.
- **See-Through workflow:** manually open the ST API page to connect to a separately running local service, upload images, follow decomposition progress, resume results, export PSD and import it for editing. Confirmed and imported source versions are recorded separately.
- **MCP across projects:** explicit `tab_id` targeting and write leases; existing tools coexist with upstream authoring tools, independently of the visible tab.
- **Eye and mesh repairs:** preserve soft edges and fine eyelash contours, improve closed-eye remnants and eyebrow ordering, and stop mesh regeneration when authored vertex keyforms or glue would be affected. See [Eye and mesh reliability](docs/eye-rig-reliability.md).
- **Preview and file dialogs:** reused Skia textures, batched mesh drawing and native Windows open/save/folder pickers with a single cancellation flow.

Upstream deform paths, texture upscaling, PSD re-export, display scaling and preferences are also included. See [Project tabs and MCP](docs/project-tabs.md), [Source workflow](docs/source-workflow.md) and [Preview performance](docs/preview-performance.md). Existing `.psd2live` archives, MCP configuration names and `PSD2LIVE_MCP_TOKEN` remain compatible.

The merged version passed 211 automated tests and packaged-runtime checks on 2026-09-16. These do not replace native-window, Cubism Editor or real-model visual acceptance.

## Core Features

- **Adaptive Mesh Generation**: Separable Gaussian alpha pre-filtering and adaptive binarization; periodic cubic Bézier fitting with physical support window corner detection and curvature-weighted adaptive resampling (up to 12x); constrained Delaunay triangulation with topology-convergent Lawson flips and overlong internal edge bisection.

    <br>
    <em>Mesh spacing at 22 / 64 / 115 px: density comparison from detailed contours to lightweight topology</em>
  </p>
- **Deformer (Warp) Generation**:
  - **Eye & Mouth Deformation**: Shared projective plane constraints for eyes and brows, iris counter-translation against perspective compression, and eyelash alpha-weighted centerline tracking for smooth closed U-curves; centripetal compression of full-open mouth toward central seam with auto-clipped teeth and tongue.
  - **Nine-Pose Lattice Construction**: `AngleX (±45°) × AngleY (±30°)` 8×8 facial lattice combining C1-continuous horizontal roll (near-side reveal, broad plateau preservation, far-side compression), vertical V/^ pitch curvature, and diagonal $C_{xy} = \text{yaw} \times \text{pitch}$ cross-terms.
- **Animation**: Automated generation of a 6-second seamless looping `idle.motion3.json` covering breathing, subtle head/body sway, and natural eye blinks; desktop GUI supports optional integration with official Cubism 5-r.5 SDK native offscreen OpenGL rendering for **100% official rendering & physical dynamics parity (Ground Truth)** (this project does NOT include or redistribute proprietary SDK binaries, see [SDK Setup Guide](docs/en/guide/CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md); automatically falls back to pure CPU high-precision software rasterization when SDK is absent) with live mouse gaze tracking (Mouse Look).
- **Physics**: Decoupled front and back hair following the head container with root-pinned, $v^3$ cubic tip sway multi-pendulum dynamics; eyelid closure velocity driving second-order damped harmonic oscillators for pupil jelly squash/stretch dynamics (`ParamEyeBallForm`).
- **Editable Agent / MCP Workspace**: A bearer-authenticated local Streamable HTTP MCP lets ChatGPT/Codex, Gemini/Antigravity, and other MCP hosts inspect the project, render spatially reversible PNG Views, import transparent assets, manage parameters, and edit multidimensional keyforms on meshes, warp/rotation deformers, parts, and glue. Every mutation enters a persistent, append-only branch history with resumable task checkpoints.
- **Project & Runtime Export**: Synchronized one-click export of editable Live2D Cubism Modeler 5 `.cmo3` projects and `.moc3` runtime families (`.model3.json`, `.cdi3.json`, `physics3.json`, `idle.motion3.json`, and texture atlases); enforced three-stage geometric integrity gates (neutral pose fidelity, extreme angle bounds, and warp lattice mirror symmetry).

### Agent Capabilities and Implementation Status

Planned work is listed in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) and measured capability results are in [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md). Both are Chinese-only.

- **Available**: add hair accessories or decorations, then check occlusion, placement and deformation across parameter poses.
- **Interfaces available; full workflows still need validation**: parameter and keyform editing, layer separation, asset import, deform paths and physics. Complex tasks such as expressions, hair separation with occlusion fill, waving motion and generated artwork with nine-axis adjustment still need real-model validation.
- **Beyond reach**: precise per-point deformation of a part, which requires driving Warp and Mesh points individually.

> [!WARNING]
> Complex automated tasks remain unstable end to end. Unless you are debugging the program, we recommend not attempting them. Existing MCP interfaces do not mean an Agent can complete a task; repeated generation, positioning and correction can quickly consume large amounts of tokens and image-generation quota without producing a usable result.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These workflows require both the selected model and the Agent harness to expose a working image-generation capability. A model that can only understand text or images, but cannot generate and return an image, cannot complete asset creation and import.

Results depend on the model, image generator, Agent harness, prompt, and the quality of the original PSD layer separation. Passing regression tests for the underlying tools does not establish the reliability of those tasks.

**Help wanted: prompt engineering and Agent workflow contributions.** We especially need help with tool discovery and selection, depth and occlusion reasoning for part separation, generation constraints, positioning and correction workflows, token budgets, and stopping conditions. Reproducible cases, effective prompt or MCP workflow improvements, implementations, and evaluation cases are welcome. Including the model and host used, actual consumption, and both successful and failed results helps us verify whether a change really raises completion rates and reduces wasted retries. A single successful demonstration is not enough to mark these capabilities as complete. For general ways to take part, see [Contributing](#contributing).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Java Runtime**: Windows packages downloaded from Releases include a runtime. JDK 21 or higher is required only when building or launching from source with Gradle.
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 x64 (supports 100% pixel-perfect official rendering & physics parity when configured with official Native SDK), Linux / macOS (software rasterization)
- **Live2D Official SDK Notice**: Source code and release packages **do NOT include or redistribute** official Live2D proprietary SDK binaries. Full pipeline generation and CPU preview work 100% out of the box. To enable official runtime consistency verification on Windows, please refer to the [Live2D SDK Setup Guide](docs/en/guide/CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md).

### Launching the Desktop GUI

- **Windows Quick Launch**: Run `run-gui.bat` in the repository root.
- **Gradle Launch**:
  ```powershell
  # Windows
  .\gradlew.bat run

  # Linux / macOS
  ./gradlew run
  ```

#### Common Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut / Gesture |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Zoom** | Mouse Wheel (`0.05x ~ 64.0x`) |
| **Pan** | Middle Click Drag / Left Click Blank Drag |
| **Center & Fit** | `F` / `Home` / `0` |
| **Select Mesh** | Left Click on Mesh |
| **Open project / Import PSD** | `Ctrl + O` / `Ctrl + Shift + O` |
| **Save / Save as / Save all** | `Ctrl + S` / `Ctrl + Shift + S` / `Ctrl + Alt + S` |
| **New tab / Close current tab** | `Ctrl + N` / `Ctrl + W` |
| **Reanalyze** | `Ctrl + R` |
| **Generate & Export** | `Ctrl + G` |
| **Export To...** | `Ctrl + Shift + G` |

#### Connecting an AI Agent / MCP Host

1. Keep the AIlive2dpsd desktop app running and open **Tools → MCP → MCP Connection & Prompts…**.
2. Copy the matching configuration: HTTP TOML for ChatGPT desktop/Codex, or HTTP JSON for Gemini/Antigravity. Other Streamable HTTP hosts use the displayed endpoint and `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header; do not change it to the legacy `/sse` endpoint.
3. Use the Stdio JSON fallback only for hosts without HTTP MCP support. It runs the repository-root `mcp_proxy.py` with Python 3 and reads `PSD2LIVE_MCP_TOKEN`; on Windows it can also read the token saved by AIlive2dpsd.
4. Call `tab_list`, choose a `tab_id`, then call `inspect` (`scope: project`) with that ID at the top level. Before writing, call `tab_claim` and include its `lease_id` alongside `tab_id`. Tools with nested `request` arguments use the same top-level routing fields. See [Project tabs and MCP](docs/project-tabs.md).

The MCP currently exposes project/layer/parameter reads, object and keyform editing, parameter CRUD, model-data PNG Views, transparent-asset import, soft deletion, and append-only branch history. Every project edit that advances `HEAD` must use the latest `state`. After a timeout or disconnect, call `inspect` (`scope: project`) and `revision` (`list`) before deciding whether to retry.

AIlive2dpsd provides model Views, spatial mapping and PNG import. Artwork can use original pixels, SVG, painting or an available image editor according to style and user preference. Native PNG alpha is retained when solid_background is omitted. See the [MCP interface contract](docs/zh/agent/MCP_AUTHORING.md).

## PSD Naming Reference

> [!TIP]
> **Key PSD Artwork & Composition Guidelines**:
> - **Mouth open with stroke outlines preferred**: Author the mouth in a fully open state; clean outline strokes along the lip contour ensure clean fusion into a crisp seam upon centripetal closure.
> - **Eyelashes upper half only**: The `eyelash` layer must strictly contain upper eyelashes (no lower lashes) to ensure proper U-shaped blink curve morphing.
> - **Initial head tilt supported**: Initial character head tilt is permitted; the pipeline automatically estimates this initial angle and uses it as the neutral origin to calibrate rotation limits.
> - **Body must remain upright (excessive tilt unsupported)**: Kinematics and breathing rely on a vertical canvas frame; severely tilted or reclining poses are unsupported.
> 
> See the [PSD Layer Specification](docs/en/spec/PSD_LAYER_SPEC.md) for full rules.

## Contributing

Contributions of every kind are welcome, whether you are an illustrator, a Live2D rigger, a developer, or someone who has just started using the tool. **Issues and pull requests are equally valuable**, and there is no change too small to be worth sending.

### Opening an issue

Please open an issue for problems, questions or ideas:

- **Bug reports**: crashes, failed exports, mesh or physics anomalies, results that do not match expectations.
- **PSD compatibility problems**: a layered PSD that is misclassified or fails to generate. Attaching a reproducible PSD, or describing its layer naming, helps enormously.
- **Feature requests**: new parts, new parameters, new export options, or automation that saves you work.
- **Documentation and tutorial gaps**: anything unclear, missing steps, or text that no longer matches the interface.
- **Showcases and field notes**: models you built with AIlive2dpsd, pitfalls you hit, and layering tricks that worked.

Including the AIlive2dpsd version, your operating system, the PSD layer structure and naming, reproduction steps, expected versus actual results, and any log-dock output or screenshots makes triage much faster. Incomplete reports are fine too, and we will work out the details together.

### Sending a pull request

**Pull requests of any size are welcome**, from fixing a typo to implementing a whole new algorithm:

- **Documentation**: typo fixes, extra tutorial steps, and translations. The `en` and `ja` documents still have gaps, see the [documentation index](docs/README.md).
- **Tests and fixtures**: coverage for existing behaviour, PSD samples that reproduce a problem, and better evaluation cases.
- **Bug fixes**: from edge cases to geometry and physics solving.
- **Features and algorithms**: meshing, deformer construction, physics parameters, export compatibility.
- **Agent and MCP workflows**: prompts, tool design and selection strategy, separation and placement flows, token budgets and stop conditions. This area needs the most help right now; see the [Agent design](docs/zh/agent/AGENT_DESIGN.md) document.
- **Performance and platforms**: startup time, memory use, and behaviour on Linux and macOS.

Before you start:

1. Open an issue describing what you intend to change, so we can avoid duplicate work and agree on the direction.
2. Branch from `master`, keep the change focused, and write commit messages that explain what changed and why.
3. Reference the related issue in the pull request description and describe how you verified the change, for example with screenshots or generated model files.

### Areas that are not stable yet

Several capabilities are documented as theoretically possible but not yet reliable, such as automatic hair separation or Agent-generated expression variants. Contributions there are especially welcome: even a small gain in success rate, or simply recording why an attempt failed, is real progress. Background and acceptance criteria live in the [Agent design](docs/zh/agent/AGENT_DESIGN.md) document and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

If you are not sure where to start, open an issue describing your idea, your use case, or the area you would like to work on. We are glad to find a good entry point together.

Thank you to everyone who files an issue, shares a case, or sends code. This project is better because of you.
