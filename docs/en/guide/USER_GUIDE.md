## Desktop GUI Overview

The main window is structured as **Left Workspace + Right Inspector + Independent Bottom Log Dock and Status Bar**.

- **Menu Bar**:
  - **File**: `Open PSD...` (`Ctrl + O`), `Reanalyze` (`Ctrl + R`), `Open Output Directory`, `Generate & Export` (`Ctrl + G`), `Export To...` (`Ctrl + Shift + G`), `Exit`.
  - **Language**: Instant switching between Simplified Chinese (`zh`), English (`en`), and Japanese (`ja`).
  - **View**: Canvas display, annotations, UI & font scale, `Preferences & Settings…` (`Ctrl + ,`).
  - **Tools**: `Texture Upscale…` (`Ctrl + U`), **MCP** (`MCP Connection & Prompts…`, `View Version History Tree…`).
  - **Help**: Version and license notices.
- **Split Pane Divider**: Drag to adjust the Workspace/Inspector ratio within `25% ~ 85%`.

---

## Workspace Views

### 1. Hierarchy View
- **Deformer & Drawable Tree**: Displays the full deformer hierarchy (`BodyXY` -> `BodyZ_Breath` -> `HeadRotation` -> `HeadContainer` -> `FaceNinePose` -> Feature Warps -> ArtMeshes).
- **VS Code Style Tree Guides**: Clean indentation guide lines with expand/collapse arrows.
- **Ear Tab Collapse**: Click the collapse button in the header to minimize the hierarchy tree into a compact side tab, maximizing canvas area.

### 2. Topology View
- **Mesh Wireframe Overlay**: Renders the adaptive Delaunay triangulation over the semi-transparent canvas.
- **Selection Highlight**: Selected ArtMeshes are highlighted in bold wireframe (2.2px).
- **Statistics Badge**: Displays active drawable count, total vertices, total triangles, and current zoom level.

### 3. Preview View
- **Native Cubism 5-r.5 Engine (Optional)**: On Windows x86-64, supports offscreen OpenGL rendering via JNA using the official Live2D Cubism Core & Framework library (`live2d_renderer.dll`) to achieve **100% faithful rendering and physical dynamics parity with the official runtime (Ground Truth)**.
  - *Note: To comply with Live2D's Proprietary License, this repository does NOT include or redistribute official SDK binaries. See [Live2D Cubism SDK Configuration Guide](CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md) for setup instructions.*
- **Built-in Pure CPU Software Rasterizer**: Automatically active when the official SDK is absent or on non-Windows platforms (macOS / Linux); provides 100% out-of-the-box preview and slider inspection without any manual configuration.
- **Interactive Features**: Real-time mouse gaze tracking, 6-second breathing/blink idle loop, and blink-driven eye jelly dynamics.
- **Status Badge**: Bottom-left pill displays current zoom percentage, underlying engine type (`Native Cubism` or `Software Fallback`), and physics state.

### 4. History View
- **Append-only Branch Tree**: Shows immutable nodes created by the system, user, and Agent. A green `HEAD` badge marks the active workspace version; editing after restoring an older node creates a new branch without deleting the old future.
- **Navigation**: Drag the canvas to pan, use `-` / `+` to zoom or reset the view, and search summaries, node IDs, or actors.
- **Inspect and Restore**: Select a node to view its ID, parent, revision hash, actor, and timestamp. “Restore to this node” rebuilds its editable assets and rig without deleting any history node.

## Independent Log Dock

Logs remain visible below Hierarchy, Topology, Preview, and History instead of occupying a workspace tab:

- Click the header chevron to collapse or expand it; drag its top edge to resize it between `80` and `450 px`.
- Filter by All, System, Agent/MCP, or Images Only; search messages, tags, and details; and toggle auto-scroll. The header reports both log and image counts.
- Rendered Views and imported assets appear as inline thumbnails. Click one to open a larger checkerboard preview with dimensions, file size, and a Copy Image action.
- Clear affects only the current UI log. Copy Log copies the filtered text and does not modify history or task records.

## Connecting an AI Agent / MCP Host

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../imgs/agent.png" alt="PSD2Live AI Agent asset generation, integration, and multi-parameter rendering workflow" />
  <br>
  <em>Inspect model Views, generate through the host-native image tool, import a layer, and verify multiple parameter poses</em>
</p>

At startup, PSD2Live exposes a bearer-authenticated Streamable HTTP MCP at `127.0.0.1:23871/mcp`. Keep the app running. Treat the token as local workspace write access; do not publish or commit it.

1. Open **Tools → MCP → MCP Connection & Prompts…**.
2. On Connection Config, copy the matching configuration and prefer native Streamable HTTP:
   - ChatGPT desktop / Codex: merge the HTTP TOML into `~/.codex/config.toml`, or `.codex/config.toml` in a trusted project, restart the client, and check `/mcp`.
   - Gemini / Antigravity: merge the `psd2live` HTTP JSON entry into `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, then refresh MCP Servers.
   - Other HTTP hosts: use the displayed endpoint with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Do not switch to the legacy `/sse` endpoint.
   - Stdio-only hosts: copy the Stdio JSON and run the repository-root `mcp_proxy.py` with Python 3. The bridge reads `PSD2LIVE_MCP_ENDPOINT` (defaulting to the address above), `PSD2LIVE_MCP_TOKEN`, and optional `PSD2LIVE_MCP_TIMEOUT`. On Windows, it can fall back to the credential saved by PSD2Live.
3. The Installation Prompt tab contains the complete setup prompt. List tools after connecting, then call `inspect` with `scope: project` for the project and history HEAD summary.

Current tools include:

| Capability | Tools and branches |
| :--- | :--- |
| Project inspection | `inspect`: `scope` is `project`/`objects`/`layers`/`parameters`/`physics`; or `target:"kind:id"` for one object's direct parameter axes, channels and parent chain; also `query`, `offset`, `limit` (1–64) |
| Local deformation | `deform`: `state` + `changes` (1–128), each with `target`, `key`, `operations` (1–16) and optional `selection`; operations are `translate`/`scale`/`rotate`/`arc`/`curve`/`landmarks`, `selection` accepts `rect`/`center`+`radius`/`line`+`radius`, plus `feather` and `hardness` |
| Keyforms | `form`: `state` + `changes` (1–128), `op` is `seed`/`copy`/`set`/`delete`; writes channels or a Rotation form, never mesh point arrays |
| Independent Warp | `rig`: `state`, `name`, `targets` (1–64 meshes sharing one Warp parent); creates a fitted independent Warp and returns the new `target` |
| Model Views | `view`: `mode` is `model`/`layer`/`context`/`coverage`/`poses`/`motion`/`compare`; `poses` returns one labeled sheet, `motion` samples the timeline, `compare` diffs across history nodes |
| Parameter definitions | `parameter`: `mode` is `create`/`update` |
| Transparent assets and layers | `asset`: `mode` is `create`/`split`/`reference`/`import`/`register`/`preview`/`add`/`place`/`finalize`/`inspect`/`reprocess`/`remove` |
| Physics | `physics`: `mode` is `put` |
| Structure and appearance | `appearance`: `state` + `edits`, one ordered edit covering rename, show/hide and reparenting |
| Saving and history | `revision`: `mode` is `save`/`checkpoint`/`list`/`restore` |

Every project edit that advances `HEAD` must carry the current `state`; use the returned node as the base for the next edit. Staging a PNG does not move `HEAD`. After a timeout, disconnect, or expired session, the commit state may be unknown. Reconnect and call `inspect` (`scope: project`) and `revision` (`list`) to check the commit state and the affected objects before deciding whether to retry. The Stdio bridge automatically retries only safe read calls, never project edits.

PNG Views retain reversible pixel/canvas mappings. Use reference_id with `asset` (`register`) for placement, or the legacy spatial_reference_id path. Artwork may use original pixels, SVG, painting or available image tools. Omit solid_background to preserve native alpha; declare an actual matte explicitly when removal is desired. See the [MCP interface contract](../../zh/agent/MCP_AUTHORING.md).

History, tasks, spatial references, and SHA-256-deduplicated RGBA assets are persistent. The default Windows store is `%LOCALAPPDATA%/PSD2Live/agent-workspaces`; override it with the JVM property `psd2live.agent.store`. Reloading a PSD with the same normalized path and file signature restores its last `HEAD`.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Import**: Drag and drop a layered `.psd` file into the application window.
2. **Review & Tune**: Confirm semantic assignments in the Layers Table; check mesh triangulation in Topology View; test mouse tracking in Preview View.
3. **Optional Agent Refinement**: Connect an MCP host and use model Views for parameter, keyform, or asset edits. Confirm the active `HEAD` in History; restoring an older node and editing from it creates a branch.
4. **Export**: Set target directory and format toggles; click `Generate & Export` (`Ctrl+G`) to produce model files.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **Q: The Agent cannot connect, or reconnecting reports an expired session.**
  A: Keep PSD2Live running and recopy the current endpoint and token from the connection dialog. Native HTTP hosts must use `/mcp`, not `/sse`; Stdio hosts should run `mcp_proxy.py`. Reinitialize after session expiry and read `inspect` (`scope: project`) plus `revision` (`list`) before resuming mutations.
- **Q: Does restoring an old history node delete later edits?**
  A: No. Nodes are append-only and immutable. Restore moves only the workspace `HEAD`; editing from that node creates a new branch while the original future remains available.

- **Q: Java runtime version error on launch?**
  A: Ensure JDK 21+ is installed and `JAVA_HOME` is configured.
- **Q: Why are certain layers labeled as unknown?**
  A: Layers not matching known naming patterns are classified as unknown and assigned to head or body containers by spatial position. You can manually assign semantics in the Layers Table.
- **Q: Why does the eyelash distort or tear on blink closure?**
  A: Check if lower eyelashes or complete lower lid contours are included in the `eyelash` layer. The blink algorithm pulls the alpha-weighted centerline downward into a U-shape; merged lower lashes drag the centroid to the eyeball center and cause collision tearing. **Eyelashes must strictly be authored on the upper half of the eye**. Move lower lashes to `facedetail` or an independent static layer.
- **Q: Why does the mouth look blurred or muddy when closed?**
  A: The `mouth` layer must be drawn in a **fully open state**, and **crisp outline strokes on the lips are strongly recommended**. Upon closure, the mesh is centripetally compressed; clean outline strokes merge neatly into a sharp seam, whereas unbordered soft paint easily blurs or blends into adjacent skin.
- **Q: If the source artwork has a tilted head, is it snapped upright? How are rotation ranges computed?**
  A: The head is not forcibly straightened. The pipeline estimates the authored tilt (`initialAngleZ`) from facial baselines, aligning `DeformHeadRotation` to this tilt. The 9-pose facial lattice and `ParamAngleZ` ($\pm 30^\circ$) **calibrate their rotation limits around this initial angle as the neutral origin**. Keep initial head roll within natural limits ($\pm 25^\circ$).
- **Q: Are heavily reclining, sideways, or horizontal character poses supported?**
  A: **Excessive body tilt is not supported**. Torso kinematics (`ParamBodyAngleX/Y`) and chest breathing (`ParamBreath`) are formulated on a vertical canvas reference frame. Severe body tilts cause breathing to deform sideways and induce shear tearing under torso rotation. Keep character bodies predominantly upright.
- **Q: Why does the pupil stay visible when the eye closes?**
  A: Iris layers are clipped by eye-white (`eyewhite`). Verify that an `eyewhite` layer is present so eye closure shrinks the clipping mask.
- **Q: Exported `.cmo3` prompts about missing source art in Cubism Editor?**
  A: The base meshes are constructed from the generated atlas slices (`MissingSourceArt` is expected and normal). Keyforms, deformers, and parameters remain fully editable.
- **Q: Why does the Preview viewport show "Software Rasterizer"? How do I enable official runtime consistency verification?**
  A: PSD2Live strictly complies with open source licensing and Live2D's Proprietary License terms; **proprietary Live2D SDK binaries are NOT distributed with the source or releases**. Without the SDK, the application smoothly uses the built-in CPU software rasterizer (full model analysis, rigging, and `.cmo3`/`.moc3` exports are completely unaffected). If you want to enable official shader rendering to achieve **100% pixel-perfect parity with official game clients / Cubism Viewer (Ground Truth)**, please follow the [Live2D Cubism SDK Configuration Guide](CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md).

## Portable projects and history

After importing a PSD (Ctrl+Shift+O), choose a custom folder, the PSD folder, or `projects` in the application installation. Confirming creates a `.psd2live` file immediately. Unwritable locations report an error; existing files require an overwrite choice. Cancel leaves an unsaved workspace.

Use Ctrl+O to open a project, Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+Shift+S to save as. The unencrypted ZIP contains the original PSD, images, all history branches, rig/configuration, Agent records and workspace UI state. Transfer the single file to move the project. Saving is separate from Cubism export; closing or switching prompts about unsaved changes.

Each save immediately appends a history node, even when unchanged. Failed writes preserve the old file; edits during saving stay dirty. The history UI supports titles, notes, hiding/showing branches and checkout. Hidden branches retain their data. Ctrl+Z undoes; Ctrl+Y redoes or opens branch selection. MCP exposes `revision` (`save`/`checkpoint`) and records each successful model modification. See [the format reference](../spec/PROJECT_FORMAT.md).
