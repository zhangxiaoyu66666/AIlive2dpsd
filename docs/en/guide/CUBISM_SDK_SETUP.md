## Core Value: Consistency Over Pure Acceleration

> [!NOTE]
> **The primary purpose of configuring the official SDK is NOT performance acceleration, but strict visual and behavioral Consistency with official production environments.**

In the Live2D asset pipeline, rendering and physics calculations are governed by proprietary runtime rules:
1. **Pixel-Perfect Rendering & Masking Parity**:
   - The official Framework shaders define exact formulas for Premultiplied Alpha, color blending modes (Multiply, Screen, Add, ColorBlend), and dedicated offscreen FBO clipping mask / inverted mask sampling.
   - Pure CPU software rasterization inevitably incurs minor nuances in interpolation or color blending. The official Native SDK guarantees that every stroke, clipping boundary, and blend mode in PSD2Live matches **Cubism Viewer** and live game engines bit-for-bit, eliminating edge artifacts, black fringes, or alpha bleed.
2. **Physics & Dynamics Consistency**:
   - Hair pendulums, chest breathing, and eye jelly bounce are evaluated by the official `Live2D_Update` physics subsystem.
   - Using the official runtime guarantees that the exported `physics3.json` exhibits the exact same damping, gravity response, and swing amplitude in production as seen during authoring.
3. **Authoritative Ground Truth Verification**:
   - The official SDK acts as the gold standard to verify that the generated `.moc3`, `.model3.json`, and motions are fully compatible with official runtime specifications before shipping.
   - *(Hardware acceleration and fluid framerates are welcome byproducts; rendering fidelity and behavioral consistency are the true objectives.)*

## Out-of-the-Box Usage (No SDK Required)

**PSD2Live operates completely independently without the official SDK:**

- **Full Pipeline Independence**: PSD layer semantic classification, connected-component splitting, adaptive Delaunay triangulation, 9-axis face deformer assembly, eye jelly / pendulum physics dynamics, idle motion generation, and full export of editable `.cmo3` projects and runtime `.moc3` file families are **100% powered by the built-in pipeline and work completely out of the box**.
- **Built-in Software Rasterizer**: When the official SDK is not configured or when running on macOS/Linux, the GUI preview viewport automatically falls back to an internal pure CPU software rasterizer, supporting real-time mesh deformation and parameter slider inspection.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Obtain the Official SDK

1. Visit the Live2D SDK Download Center: [Live2D Cubism SDK for Native Download](https://www.live2d.com/en/sdk/download/native/).
2. Review and agree to the *Live2D Proprietary Software License Agreement*.
3. Download the **Cubism 5 SDK for Native** archive (e.g. `CubismSdkForNative-5-r.5.zip`) and extract it locally.

### Step 2: Extract OpenGL Shaders

1. Open the extracted SDK folder and navigate to:
   ```text
   CubismSdkForNative-5-r.5/Framework/src/Rendering/OpenGL/Shaders/Standard/
   ```
2. This directory contains 16 `.frag` fragment shaders and 6 `.vert` vertex shaders.
3. Copy all 22 shader files into a `FrameworkShaders/` folder in your target deployment directory.

### Step 3: Obtain or Build the Native Renderer DLL

`live2d_renderer.dll` is a lightweight native wrapper that statically links against `Live2DCubismCore_MD.lib` and the Native Framework from the SDK.

If building from source (requires CMake 3.16+ and Visual Studio 2022 MSVC toolchain):
1. Verify `Core/lib/windows/x86_64/143/Live2DCubismCore_MD.lib` exists in your extracted SDK.
2. Verify `Samples/OpenGL/thirdParty/glew` and `stb` exist.
3. Run CMake build:
   ```powershell
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -B build
   cmake --build build --config Release --target live2d_renderer
   ```
4. Copy the resulting `live2d_renderer.dll` to your target directory.

### Step 4: Deploy to Target Path (3 Methods)

PSD2Live automatically searches for runtime files using the following priorities:

#### Method 1: Deploy to Project Internal Resources (Recommended)
Place `live2d_renderer.dll` and the `FrameworkShaders` folder into:
```text
psd2live/src/main/resources/cubism/windows-x86_64/
```
> [!NOTE]
> This path is ignored in `.gitignore` and exists only on your local machine; **it will never be committed to Git**. When executing Gradle builds or launch scripts, Gradle bundles it into the runtime classpath.

#### Method 2: Deploy to Project Root Directory
Create a `cubism` directory at the `psd2live` root:
```text
psd2live/cubism/windows-x86_64/
```
Place `live2d_renderer.dll` and `FrameworkShaders/` inside. (This path is also ignored by `.gitignore`).

#### Method 3: Specify via Environment Variable or JVM Property
If you maintain the binaries in an external tools directory (e.g. `D:\SDK\live2d_cubism_runtime`):
- **Environment Variable**: Set `CUBISM_SDK_PATH` or `LIVE2D_SDK_PATH` pointing to that directory.
  ```powershell
  [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CUBISM_SDK_PATH", "D:\SDK\live2d_cubism_runtime", "User")
  ```
- **JVM Argument**: Add `-Dpsd2live.cubism.path="D:\SDK\live2d_cubism_runtime"` when starting the JVM.

## Verification & Runtime Status

Launch the application:
```powershell
.\run-gui.bat
```

Load any model or PSD and inspect the status pill in the lower-left corner of the **Preview** viewport:
- **`Native Cubism (Live Physics)`** or **`Native Cubism`**: Indicates official Native SDK loaded successfully and GPU offscreen rendering is active.
- **`Software Rasterizer`**: Indicates SDK was not found or running on a non-Windows OS; the app has gracefully fallen back to CPU rendering without loss of core functionality.
- If any component fails to load (e.g. missing shaders), a diagnostic message is displayed in red in the upper-left viewport corner.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Does omitting the SDK affect exporting `.cmo3` and `.moc3`?
**Not at all for core generation and export, but the official SDK provides authoritative ground-truth consistency.** All geometry generation, deformer hierarchy assembly, and file formatting are implemented in pure Kotlin/Java code. The core value of configuring the SDK lies in guaranteeing that clipping mask transparencies, premultiplied alpha blending, and physics dynamics match official game client runtimes with 100% fidelity before export.

### Q2: Error `Missing Cubism SDK 5-r.5 runtime resource: live2d_renderer.dll`
Check that:
1. `live2d_renderer.dll` is placed in one of the three supported locations;
2. Your operating system is Windows 64-bit;
3. If using Method 3, verify that `CUBISM_SDK_PATH` is correctly exported (restart your terminal/IDE after setting).

### Q3: Why does Git show `src/main/resources/cubism/` as deleted?
This is intentional for open source compliance. Proprietary Live2D binaries have been removed from git tracking and added to `.gitignore`. Your local files remain intact on disk.
